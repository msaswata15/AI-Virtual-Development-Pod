# AI Virtual Development Pod

The AI Virtual Development Pod is a project that simulates an AI-powered software development team handling the complete software development lifecycle (SDLC). The system comprises multiple AI agents, each performing a specialized role such as Business Analyst, Design Agent, Developer, Testing Agent, and Project Manager. These agents work together to generate user stories, design system architectures, write code, create test cases, and provide a final project review.
